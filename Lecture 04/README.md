### Topics covered in this lecture:
1. Priority Queue
    - Implements a set S of elements 
    - Each element is associated with a key
2. Heaps
    - Implementation of a priority queue
    - Done using an array
    - Supported functions
        - max_heapify()
        - build_max_heap()
        - extract_max()
        - max()
        - insert()
3. Heapsort
    - Using the functions above, we can sort a list in O(n log n) asymptotic complexity
