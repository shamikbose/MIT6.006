# MIT6.006
 This repository contains solutions to problems discussed in the lectures for the ["Intro to Algorithms"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) course taught at MIT. The course material can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-006-introduction-to-algorithms-fall-2011/index.htm). The solutions to the algorithms presented in the lectures are shown as interactive notebooks in this repo. Happy learning!
